___

### How to Score

#### Strike
* If you knock down all 10 pins in the first shot of a frame, you get a strike.
* A strike earns 10 points plus the sum of your next two shots.

#### Spare
* If you knock down all 10 pins using both shots of a frame, you get a spare.
* A spare earns 10 points plus the sum of your next one shot.

#### Open Frame
* If you do not knock down all 10 pins using both shots of your frame (9 or fewerpins knocked down), you have an open frame.

* An open frame only earns the number of pins knocked down.

#### The 10th Frame
* If you roll a strike in the first shot of the 10th frame, you get 2 more shots.
* The score for the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down in the 10th frame.
* If you roll a spare in the first two shots of the 10th frame, you get 1 more shot.
* If you leave the 10th frame open after two shots, the game is over and you do not get an additional shot.
